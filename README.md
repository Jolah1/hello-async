#  Hello Async – Race Two URLs and Fetch the Fastest Title

A mini asynchronous Rust CLI tool that fetches two web pages concurrently and returns the page title of the one that responds first. ⚡️

This project showcases:
- Async programming with [`tokio`](https://docs.rs/tokio)
- HTML parsing with `trpl` and `Html::parse`
- Timeout handling for slow responses
- Graceful error management
